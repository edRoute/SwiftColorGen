                A tool that generate code for Swift projects, designed to improve the maintainability of UIColors.
                SwiftColorGen reads all storyboard files to find common sRGB colors.
                Then it creates those colors in a .xcassets folder and refer them in the storyboard.
                Finally it creates a UIColor extension allowing to access the same colors programatically.
